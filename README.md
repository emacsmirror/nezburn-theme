# nezburn-theme

The nezburn theme (inspired on zenburn) for Emacs. Very cool.

## Description

The theme is directly inspired by the [zenburn theme for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs/tree/master), based on its composition, in addition to receiving color tones inspired by the [Pale Fire theme](https://github.com/matklad/pale-fire).

Its composition includes simple colors for a better reuse of tones. The theme is necessarily a theme geared towards using the dark development environment.
